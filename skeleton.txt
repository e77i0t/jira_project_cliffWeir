General process of how I envision this program functioning. References "EOD Generation Pre-Alpha" and "metabase query"
1. Request issues from Production Incidents board
2. Add issues to a list we'll call "workable" (each element in the list is a separate issue) if the issue occurred
 during the current day
3. Sort that list based on orb site (This is hypothetical as I haven't had any hands on experience with Kindreds Jira
 but based on my own testing each issue should have the orb site listed along with the orb number and a bunch of other
 info). So "workable" will be sorted into either lists or a single dictionary. In the case of a dictionary each key
 would refer to the orb site. In the case of lists each list would be titled according to the orb site.
4. For metabase information, I've run into a wall. I use my google account to log in. Because of this, I don't have a
 password stored that is linked to my email. This prevents me from getting a token to make any get requests. This should
 be easy(ish) to resolve after getting my initial code reviewed.
5. Everything after part 3 and 4 is a bit abstract since I don't currently have access to Kindreds jira and metabase.
 The plan is to run the information through (refined) loops like what I have right now, replacing the downtime
 calculations with the results from metabase. Tack on the units sorted, make sure everything is formatted and save the
 results to a txt document. Depending on how well everything goes, I'd consider adapting it to be run by a Boty McBot
 Face command, but as of now that's a fever dream.
